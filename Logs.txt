NOTE: We initially construct the code in our independent laptop without uploading it on GitHub. Since this is our first time using GitHub, we accidentally made the editions on fork instead of main. That's why all the commits seem concentrated in the last week.

2023.2.4 meeting time: 26 mins
The first meeting for Itreration 1, the first big user story we decided to work on is the course enrollment At this iteration, we need a database, GUI for course enrollment user story, the GUI framework will be responsible by Zhige Xia
the code for course enrollment, add course, remove course, review course description, show a list of course will be responsible by Haocheng, Wenxu, and Tao

2023.2.5 Code Design Time: 2 hours 16 mins
We first of all create a random course list. At this stage, we want courses to be stored in one class with the attributes of course name, course price, course description Note: the attributes are set to be private since we don't want users to access each other's info
create a No-arg constructer that sets the course's name and description as none, and sets the price as -1 which indicates for later creation of course object, we are able to know that whether the object is created successfully

showEverything method is created for course class, which displays name, description and price
Test class is created to test whether showEverything method is working
course aerobic = new course("aerobic",1000,"enhace cardio-pulmonary function"); aerobic.showEverything();
output: [name=aerobic, price=1000, desc=enhace cardio-pulmonary function] so the funtion work
